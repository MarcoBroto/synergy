# Synergy

React Native App Template written in Typescript. Started as side project to learn React-Native and evolved into a proof of concept as an alternative to .NET Xamarin for a company tool.

The template includes a skeleton for a basic platform-native user interface and with navigation and redux starting points.
App name is a spinoff of the original product name the proof of concept was to be for.
